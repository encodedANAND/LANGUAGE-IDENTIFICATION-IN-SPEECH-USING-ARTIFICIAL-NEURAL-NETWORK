# LANGUAGE-IDENTIFICATION-IN-SPEECH-USING-ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK
This project deals with the Automatic Speech Language Identification System (LID) to accurately identify the language of speech from its small sample.We have used 4 different languages namely, **Indian English, Hindi, Bangla and Telugu**.
Artificial Neural Networks are used for making clear distintion between the speech samples of different languages.

Speech Features used for this purpose are **Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs)** and MFCCs with **Shifted Delta Cepstrum** (SDCs). 
SDCs are used for capturing more of the temporal information.We have also used simple **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** as the basic approach to solve this problem.Please refer to the report for more detailed information.
